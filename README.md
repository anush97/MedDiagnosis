# FemTherapeutics - Technical Challenge

Thank you for your interest in the position at FemTherapeutics. To assess your technical competency, please complete the following project, which focuses on applying NLP models to medical transcript data.

## Project Objective

Develop an NLP model to identify medical conditions, treatments, or therapeutic insight in the provided medical transcript dataset.

## Dataset

- Use the provided `DATA.csv` file.

## Project Guidelines

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Convert the text data into a structured format suitable for training machine learning models.
   - Document the preprocessing steps.

2. **Feature Extraction**
   - Create feature vectors from the text data using appropriate techniques.
   - Explain your chosen feature extraction methods.

3. **NLP Model**
   - Choose a suitable NLP models, technique, tools, or frameworks for the task (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe, BERT, Transformers, Hugging Face, PyTorch, etc.).
   - Justify your choices and describe the advantages and limitations in this context.

4. **Implementation and Evaluation**
   - Implement the chosen NLP model using Python and relevant libraries.
   - Evaluate your model's performance using suitable metrics.

5. **Report**
   - Submit your repo with a jupyter notebook detailing your approach, including:
       - Data preprocessing steps
       - Feature extraction techniques
       - Model choice and rationale
       - Model evaluation and results
       - Relevant visualizations
   - Clarity of explanation and documentation will be evaluated.

6. **Extra Points**
   - Evaluate and analyze keywords "Rectocele", "Cystocele" in the dataset and provide visualizations or summary statistics to illustrate findings. 

## Evaluation Criteria

- Code quality and organization
- Project structure, repo structure, and commit history
- Choice and application of NLP techniques
- Model performance and evaluation
- Documentation and report clarity

## Submission

You have 4 days to complete the project.

Please clone the provided repository and make and share your repo and commit history with us for evaluation.
