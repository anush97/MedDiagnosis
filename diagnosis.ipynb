He has been to multiple institutions as an outpatient for this complaint.  He has had what appears to be prepatellar bursa aspirated with little to no success.  He has been treated with Kefzol and 1 g of Rocephin one point.  He also reports, in the emergency department today, an attempt was made to aspirate his actual knee joint which was unsuccessful.  Orthopedic Surgery was consulted at this time.  Considering the patient's physical exam, there is a portal that would prove to be outside of the erythema that would be useful for aspiration of the knee.  After discussion of risks and benefits, the patient elected to proceed with aspiration through the anterolateral portal of his knee joint.,PROCEDURE:  ,The patient's right anterolateral knee area was prepped with Betadine times two and a 20-gauge spinal needle was used to approach the knee joint approximately 3 cm anterior and 2 cm lateral to the superolateral pole of the patella.  The 20-gauge spinal needle was inserted and entered the knee joint.  Approximately, 4 cc of clear yellow fluid was aspirated.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.,DISPOSITION: , Based upon the appearance of this synovial fluid, we have a very low clinical suspicion of a septic joint.  We will send this fluid to the lab for cell count, crystal exam, as well as culture and Gram stain.  We will follow these results.  After discussion with the emergency department staff, it appears that they tend to try to treat his erythema which appears to be cellulitis with IV antibiotics.\",\n          \"REASON FOR CONSULT:,  Depression.,HPI:,  The patient is an 87-year-old white female admitted for low back pain status post hip fracture sustained a few days before Thanksgiving in 2006.  The patient was diagnosed and treated for a T9 compression fraction with vertebroplasty.  Soon after discharge, the patient was readmitted with severe mid low back pain and found to have a T8 compression fracture.  This was also treated with vertebroplasty.  The patient is now complaining of back pain that fluctuates at time, acknowledging her pain medication works but not all the time.  Her pain is in her upper back around her shoulder blades.  The patient says lying down with the heated pad lessens the pain and that any physical activity increases it.  MRI on January 29, 2007, was positive for possible meningioma to the left of anterior box.,The patient reports of many depressive symptoms, has lost all interest in things she used to do (playing cards, reading).  Has no energy to do things she likes, but does participate in physical therapy, cries often and what she believes for no reason.  Does not see any future for herself.  Reports not being able to concentrate on anything saying she gets distracted by thoughts of how she does not want to live anymore.  Admits to decreased appetite, feeling depressed, and always wanting to be alone.  Claims that before her initial hospitalization for her hip fracture, she was highly active, enjoyed living independently at Terrace.  Denies suicidal ideations and homicidal ideations, but that she did not mind dying, and denies any manic symptoms including decreased need to sleep, inflated self-worth, and impulsivity.  Denies auditory and visual hallucinations.  No paranoid, delusions, or other abnormalities of thought content.  Denies panic attacks, flashbacks, and other feelings of anxiety.  Does admit to feeling restless at times.  Is concerned with her physical appearance while in the hospital, i.e., her hair looking \\\"awful.\\\",PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  Hypertension, cataracts, hysterectomy, MI, osteoporosis, right total knee replacement in April 2004, hip fracture, and newly diagnosed diabetes.
